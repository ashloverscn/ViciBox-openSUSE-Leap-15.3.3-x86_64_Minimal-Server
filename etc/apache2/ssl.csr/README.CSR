 This is the ssl.csr/ directory of Apache/mod_ssl
 where PEM-encoded X.509 Certificate Signing Requests for SSL are stored.

 You can also use this directory for temporarily storing CSRs from within your
 (CGI-) scripts when you want to perform client authentication with your own
 CA instance.

 You can view the ingredients of a particular CSR file in plain text
 by running the command:

   $ openssl req -noout -text -in <name>.csr
