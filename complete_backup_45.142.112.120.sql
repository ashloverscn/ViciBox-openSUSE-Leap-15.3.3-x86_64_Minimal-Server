SCRIPT fields will also only display the content in the Options, and not the field name like the DISPLAY type does.

For example - electric_meter, Electric Meter</QXZ>. <QXZ>For the SCRIPT field types, this field is where you put your script contents. You can use single quote and amphersand characters as well so that you can create links and iframe elements. If you want to put urlencoded fields in this area, make sure you use the --U-- and --V-- flags for your variables instead of using A and B, for example --U--test_field--V--. You can also use the --M-- and --N-- flags to enclose basic Math equations to have them calculated when the script is loaded initially, for example multiplying test_field by 12 would be entered with --M--(--A--test_field--B-- * 12)--N--. For the SWITCH field type, you should define the list ID for the custom fields as well as the text that you want to appear in the button to activate the new form in a comma separated line, with one line for each button you want to appear. For the SWITCH field type, it is a requirement that one of the entries be the current list ID. For BUTTON, the only current option is to put SubmitRefresh as the Field Options, which will commit any changes you have made in the form and reload the form panel. For SOURCESELECT, if this field is set to use the -province- field to determine what values to use for example, then the first line in the Field Options box should be -source=>province-, without the dashes. As a note, you can only link a SOURCESELECT menu to a source field that is a TEXT, READONLY or SELECT field type. The next options line will be the first province value to look for, for example -value=>Ontario-, and if the value for that field for the lead matches, the next lines will be the options to show with the value and display text separated by a pipe.
